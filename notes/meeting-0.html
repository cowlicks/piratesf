        <h2>Meeting #0 Notes</h2>
        <p>The meeting was held at Zeitgeist, 199 Valencia Street, on June 27th, 2016.</p>
        <p>In attendance: John Shutt, Vanessa Conyers, Joyti, Patrick O'Doherty, Casey Bowman, Torrie Fischer, Jay Addison, Steve Young, Noah Swartz.</p>
        <p>Some projects people are interested in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A hyperlocal MuckRock-type tool that would make it easy to submit public records requests to City agencies under San Francisco’s Sunshine Ordinance.</li>
          <li>Contracts with City agencies are awarded on a “points” system. We could push to add criteria to the scoring for IT contracts that would encourage the development of free software and hardware at the municipal level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Plenty of discussion about the practicality of third parties, and the importance of making practical short-term local gains. We're not getting a pirate president anytime soon. Board of Supervisors would probably take a few years. The Democratic machine is uninspiring. Wide admiration for the photo of <a href='http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/A-gravely-ill-Rose-Pak-on-life-death-and-her-6456189.php'>Rose Pak wielding a baseball bat</a>.</p>
        <p>Anyone can call meetings in the future per <a href='http://bad.debian.net/shotgun_rules.txt'>shotgun rules</a>, and accept the possibility that no one will show up.</p>
        <p>There's probably important stuff missing from these notes. No one was really writing anything down in the moment. <a href='mailto:jds@riseup.net'>Blame John</a>.</p>
